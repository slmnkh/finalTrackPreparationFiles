1 - gpsDistance.py :: used for computing distance in meters between two points whose latitude and longitude are provided

2 - markProximity.py :: Finds out which points in a track are close to an intersection center.
                        Returns an array of ones and zeros.

3 - readTracks.py :: returns a 2D numpy array that consists of track locations read from a text file

4 - top level files ::

        - step - 1 ... separateTracks.py : give path to text file from GPS sensor, saves a text file for each track in 
          vicinity of an intersection (whose center location in lat, lon is provided in def prox in markProximity.py)

        - step - 2 ... XmlExport.py : read the saved text files for each trace and make xml files from them
